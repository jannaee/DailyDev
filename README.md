# Hello, I'm Jannaee Sick and this is my personal developer's blog.

I've been looking for a way to showcase my incremental learning process while at the same time demonstarting my evolution into a profiecient designer and developer. There are many minute concepts one must grasp in design and web technologies in order to be recognized as a good Front End Developer. And this repo is where I intend to document what I'm made of.

This is the place where I will document my growth and progress as I commit myself to a personal challenge of 100 days of dev where I showcase my discoveries, projects, and achievements my personal journey deeper into UI/UX Design as well as Front End Development.

Projects will be inspired from sites such as:
* http://collectui.com/designers/sudutlancip
* Codecademy Pro 
* Udacity
* https://pttrns.com/
