Fundamentals to cover
##If Else Blocks
A statment that helps control flow of data by testing an expression if it's true it will return what is in the first set of block, if it is not then it will return the second block.

## Loops
A construct to allow something to be performed over and over

While with a test expression with a block followed by an if with an expression and a block of code to execute is true. If the test expression if false it goes to the next expresion. But as long as the test expression is true the block keeps running to the original test.
typically the syntax includes using i to intialize with a value, while keyworkd and then a condition i<10 and a block of information to ru until it's false.

##Functions
Basically code that recieves code, operates and produces outputs.
In python 
def expressionname (parameters, parameters2) : 
        block of code



Project 1, Functio practice:
First plan the break:
Ask yourself What would you need to write to take a break program?
 - How to keep track of time?
    - create function that waits 2 hours
 - Where to get the music?
    - open a browser
We also want this to repeat so we need a looping construct to allow this to happen at least 3 times:
